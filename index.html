            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a self taught front end developer.
                I'm passionate about building apps that are easy to navigate and have a clear purpose.
                To me, functionality first, styles last.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2021, I took an ethical hacking course on YouTube. I heard about bug hunting.
                I decided that I want to hunt for bugs on websites, so I did research.
                I was advised to learn the basics of web development first, so I did. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I was happy to find that I enjoy building websites, more than breaking them.
                With both skills, I know how to hack and secure websites.
